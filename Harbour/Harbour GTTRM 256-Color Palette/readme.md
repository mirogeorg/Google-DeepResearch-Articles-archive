# **A Comprehensive Guide to 256-Color ANSI/VT Display in Harbour with the GTTRM Driver**

### **Introduction: Disambiguation and Scope**

This report provides a definitive, expert-level guide for developers using the Harbour programming language to implement the full 256-color ANSI/VT palette with the GTTRM terminal driver. It is essential to first establish a clear distinction between the subject of this document and other similarly named technologies.

The **Harbour programming language** is a free, open-source, cross-platform compiler for the xBase language family, designed for 100% backward compatibility with Clipper.1 It is a robust tool for creating command-line (CLI), graphical (GUI), and web-based applications that can be compiled from a single codebase to run on numerous operating systems, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS.3

This should not be confused with the **Harbor container registry project**, an open-source cloud native registry that stores, signs, and scans container images for vulnerabilities.5 The two projects are entirely unrelated in function, origin, and scope. All subsequent references to "Harbour" within this document pertain exclusively to the programming language.

The objective of this report is to deliver a holistic solution for displaying 256 colors in a Harbour application. Success in this endeavor depends not only on correct Harbour code but also on a properly configured underlying terminal environment. Therefore, this guide adopts a multi-layered approach, addressing the foundational principles of ANSI color, the critical configuration of the terminal and shell, the architecture of Harbour's Graphic Terminal (GT) system, and finally, a practical, code-level implementation with troubleshooting guidance.

The content is tailored for intermediate to advanced Harbour developers who are proficient with the language's syntax, its standard build tool (hbmk2), and command-line operations on POSIX-compliant systems such as Linux or macOS, which are the primary targets for the GTTRM driver.

## **Section 1: The ANSI/VT 256-Color Model: A Technical Primer**

Before writing any Harbour code, it is crucial to understand the technical standard that enables 256-color display in modern terminals. This is not a continuous spectrum of colors but a well-defined, indexed palette governed by ANSI/VT escape codes. The application's role is to send these codes to standard output, and the terminal's role is to interpret them and render the corresponding colors.

### **1.1 Deconstructing the 256-Color Palette**

The standard 256-color palette is a fixed lookup table, not a dynamically chosen set of colors. It is composed of four distinct and standardized groups, each with a specific numerical range.

* **Colors 0-7: Standard System Colors.** These are the original 8 ANSI colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white. The exact hue of these colors is often configurable within the terminal emulator's settings.  
* **Colors 8-15: Bright/High-Intensity System Colors.** These are brighter versions of the first eight colors. The relationship between these colors and the "bold" attribute can be complex and terminal-dependent, a nuance that will be explored further in Section 5\.  
* **Colors 16-231: The 6x6x6 Color Cube.** This is the largest and most versatile part of the palette. It provides 216 colors ($6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \= 216$) by combining six graded levels of red, green, and blue. This cube is designed to offer a reasonably broad gamut of colors for application UIs without requiring true-color support.  
* **Colors 232-255: The Grayscale Ramp.** This final block consists of 24 shades of gray, from nearly black to almost white, providing a smooth gradient for monochromatic designs.

Understanding this discrete, structured nature is fundamental. An application cannot simply request an arbitrary RGB color like \#FF7F50; it must select the closest available color from this fixed 256-color map. Various scripts and tools exist to visualize this entire spectrum directly in the terminal, which can be invaluable for development and testing.9

### **1.2 The ANSI Escape Sequences**

Communication between an application and the terminal emulator for color control is handled via standardized control sequences, often called ANSI escape codes. For the 256-color palette, the relevant sequences are an extension of the original 8/16 color codes.

The sequence to set the foreground color is:  
\`\\e

## **Section 2: Configuring the Terminal Environment for 256-Color Support**

The most common point of failure for 256-color applications has nothing to do with the application code itself, but rather with the environment in which it runs. A critical disconnect often exists between a terminal emulator's *actual* capabilities and its *advertised* capabilities. Modern terminals almost universally support 256 colors, but for reasons of backward compatibility, many still identify themselves as older, less capable devices. Correcting this discrepancy is a mandatory prerequisite.

The successful operation of a Harbour GTTRM application is dependent on a complete and correctly configured chain of components:  
Terminal Emulator Settings → Shell Startup Scripts → $TERM Variable → terminfo Database → Harbour GTTRM Driver  
A failure at any link in this chain will cause the application to fall back to a limited 8- or 16-color mode.

### **2.1 The Central Role of the $TERM Environment Variable**

The $TERM environment variable is the primary mechanism by which a terminal describes its capabilities to any application running within it. It acts as a contract, telling programs like vim, tmux, or a Harbour executable which set of control sequences it understands.13

A $TERM value of xterm, for instance, typically implies support for only 8 or 16 colors. To signal 256-color capability, the value must be set to a descriptor that explicitly includes this feature, most commonly xterm-256color.12 An application using a library (or, in the case of GTTRM, its own internal logic) will check this variable to decide which color sequences to generate. If $TERM is set incorrectly, the application will conservatively assume a lower color depth to avoid sending unsupported codes that could garble the display.

| $TERM Value | Advertised Colors | Common Use Case/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| xterm | 8/16 | Legacy default for many terminals. Often incorrect for modern systems and a common source of color issues. |
| xterm-color | 8 | Obsolete variant of xterm. Not recommended for use. |
| xterm-16color | 16 | Describes an xterm variant with explicit support for 16 colors. |
| xterm-256color | 256 | The modern standard for any terminal emulator that supports the 256-color palette. This is the target value for most configurations.13 |
| screen | 8/16 | Default value inside GNU screen or tmux. Lacks 256-color information and must be overridden. |
| screen-256color | 256 | The correct value to use inside tmux or a properly configured GNU screen to enable 256-color support.12 |

### **2.2 The terminfo Database**

The $TERM variable is just a name. The actual definition of what that name means is stored in the terminfo (terminal information) database. This is a system-wide collection of compiled files, typically located in directories like /lib/terminfo/ or /usr/share/terminfo/, that map capabilities (e.g., "set foreground color") to the specific escape sequences required for the terminal identified by $TERM.16

For example, when $TERM is set to xterm-256color, a compliant application will look for the corresponding definition file (e.g., /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color). If this file is missing, which can happen on minimal systems or misconfigured remote servers, the application will fail to find the terminal definition and may report an error or fall back to a default, limited mode. On many Linux distributions, the necessary terminfo entries are provided by a package such as ncurses-term. While Harbour's GTTRM is designed to not rely on the ncurses library for parsing these files, the presence of the correct terminfo entry is still a strong indicator of a properly configured system and is used by many other essential command-line tools.

### **2.3 Practical Configuration Guides**

The following are step-by-step instructions for configuring common environments to correctly advertise 256-color support.

#### **GNOME Terminal and Derivatives (XFCE Terminal, MATE Terminal)**

These popular Linux terminal emulators fully support 256 colors but often default to setting $TERM=xterm. This must be overridden.

1. **Profile-Specific Method (Recommended):**  
   * Open the terminal's preferences and edit the active profile.  
   * Navigate to the "Command" tab.  
   * Check the option "Run a custom command instead of my shell."  
   * Enter the following command: env TERM=xterm-256color /bin/bash (or your preferred shell, like /bin/zsh). This ensures that any shell launched from this profile starts with the correct $TERM value.  
2. **Shell Startup Script Method:**  
   * Edit your shell's startup file (e.g., \~/.bashrc for bash, \~/.zshrc for zsh).  
   * Add the following lines to the end of the file:  
     Bash  
     if; then  
         export TERM=xterm-256color  
     fi

   * This script checks if the terminal has identified itself as a generic xterm and corrects it, but only in that specific case, avoiding interference with other terminal types like the Linux console.

#### **PuTTY (Windows SSH Client)**

Configuring PuTTY for 256 colors requires changes in two separate configuration panels.

1. **Enable 256-Color Mode:**  
   * In the configuration window, navigate to Window → Colours.  
   * Check the box labeled "Allow terminal to use xterm 256-colour mode".  
2. **Set the Terminal-Type String:**  
   * Navigate to Connection → Data.  
   * In the text box labeled "Terminal-type string," change the value from the default (xterm) to xterm-256color.  
   * Save these settings to your session profile to make them permanent.

#### **Terminal Multiplexers (tmux and GNU Screen)**

Terminal multiplexers like tmux and screen act as a terminal layer between the user and the applications running inside them. They must also be configured to handle and advertise 256-color support.

* **For tmux:**  
  * When launching, use the \-2 flag to force tmux to assume 256-color support: tmux \-2.  
  * For a permanent solution, edit or create the \~/.tmux.conf file and add the following line:  
    set \-g default-terminal "screen-256color"

  * This tells tmux to set $TERM to screen-256color for all new panes and windows, which is the correct value for applications running inside it.  
* **For GNU screen:**  
  * Configuration is more complex and can depend on how screen was compiled on the system.  
  * First, ensure you start screen from a terminal where $TERM is already set to xterm-256color.  
  * Edit or create the \~/.screenrc file and add the following lines, which instruct screen on how to handle 256-color sequences:  
    \# Enable 256-color support  
    attrcolor b ".I"  
    term screen-256color

  * This attempts to configure the running screen session for 256 colors, but success can vary between distributions.

### **2.4 Verification**

Before proceeding to Harbour development, verify the environment configuration with these simple commands:

1. **Check the $TERM variable:**  
   Bash  
   echo $TERM

   The output should be xterm-256color or screen-256color (if inside tmux).  
2. **Query tput for color count:**  
   Bash  
   tput colors

   The output should be 256\. If it reports 8 or 16, the environment is not correctly configured.  
3. **Run a palette test script:** A simple shell one-liner can quickly display the background color palette:  
   Bash  
   for i in {0..255}; do printf '\\e

Only after these verification steps pass should one proceed to compiling and running the Harbour application. This isolates environmental problems from potential code issues.

## **Section 3: An Architectural Overview of the Harbour Graphic Terminal (GT) System**

To effectively use the GTTRM driver, it is important to understand its place within Harbour's broader architecture for terminal input and output. Harbour achieves its cross-platform portability through a powerful abstraction layer known as the Graphic Terminal (GT) system.

### **3.1 The GT Abstraction Layer**

The Harbour GT system provides a device-independent API for all console-based operations, such as moving the cursor, setting colors, and displaying text. Application code written in Harbour (.prg files) calls high-level GT functions. The GT system then translates these generic commands into the specific, low-level instructions required by the selected "terminal driver".18

This architecture allows a single Harbour application to run, without source code changes, in vastly different environments. For example, the same code can render its interface in a native Windows console, a self-contained GUI window on Windows, or a standard POSIX terminal on Linux. The choice of which environment to target is determined at compile time by linking the appropriate GT driver library.

| Driver Name | Target Platform | External Dependencies | Key Feature/Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| gtwin | Windows Console | None (uses Win32 Console API) | The default driver for Harbour on Windows, providing standard console I/O.18 |
| gtwvt | Windows GUI | None (uses Win32 GUI API) | Creates a self-contained GUI window that emulates a console, allowing for font and size changes.18 |
| gtcrs / gtsln | POSIX | ncurses / slang libraries | Provides rich terminal support on \*nix systems by leveraging standard, powerful terminal-handling libraries.18 |
| gttrm | POSIX | None | Offers portable, dependency-free terminal support for modern ANSI/VT-compliant terminals on \*nix systems.18 |
| gtpca | All | None | Provides basic support for PC-ANSI terminal emulation, largely superseded by GTTRM.18 |

### **3.2 Introducing the GTTRM Driver**

The GTTRM driver is specifically engineered for POSIX-compliant operating systems like Linux, macOS, and the BSDs. Its defining characteristic and primary architectural advantage is its lack of external dependencies. Unlike drivers such as gtcrs, GTTRM does not require the ncurses or slang libraries to be installed on the target system.18 It communicates with the terminal directly by writing raw ANSI/VT escape sequences to standard output.

This design choice results in a significant trade-off. On one hand, it produces highly portable, self-contained executables that can be deployed on a wide range of \*nix systems with minimal fuss. On the other hand, it places the full burden of compatibility on the terminal emulator itself. GTTRM assumes it is communicating with a modern, standards-compliant terminal that correctly interprets ANSI escape codes. It does not perform complex capability lookups via the terminfo database in the same way ncurses does. This architectural decision makes the environmental configuration detailed in Section 2 absolutely critical for the proper functioning of any application built with GTTRM.

While the driver has hard-coded sequences for a few terminal types, its primary mode of operation relies on the terminal being a capable ANSI/VT device, which is a safe assumption for virtually any modern terminal emulator.18 It is also designed to automatically detect UTF-8 terminal modes, further enhancing its utility on modern systems.18

### **3.3 Selecting the GTTRM Driver at Compile Time**

By default, Harbour will link the gtwin driver on Windows systems. To build an application for a POSIX terminal using GTTRM, the developer must explicitly request this driver during the compilation process.

This is typically a two-step process:

1. Request the Driver in Source Code (Optional but Good Practice):  
   While hbmk2 often handles this implicitly, it is good practice to include a request for the desired GT driver at the top of the main .prg file. This makes the dependency explicit.  
   Code snippet  
   REQUEST HB\_GT\_TRM

2. Specify the Driver with hbmk2:  
   The most important step is to use the \-gttrm command-line switch when invoking the hbmk2 build tool. This instructs the build system to link the GTTRM library instead of the default.  
   Bash  
   hbmk2 myprogram.prg \-gttrm

   This command will compile myprogram.prg and link it with the GTTRM driver, producing an executable suitable for running in a Linux or macOS terminal.

## **Section 4: Implementing 256-Color Palettes in Harbour with GTTRM**

With the environment correctly configured and a solid understanding of the GTTRM driver, the final step is to implement the 256-color display within the Harbour application code. This involves moving beyond Harbour's traditional color commands and utilizing a more powerful, modern function to directly interact with the GT driver's capabilities.

### **4.1 Beyond setColor(): The Modern Approach with hb\_gtInfo()**

Harbour maintains backward compatibility with the classic Clipper setColor() function, which accepts a string argument to define foreground and background colors (e.g., setColor("B+/W\*") for bright blue on bright white).19 While this function is sufficient for the basic 16 colors, it cannot address the full 256-color palette.

To unlock advanced features of the GT system, Harbour provides the hb\_gtInfo() function. This function serves as a generic interface for querying and modifying driver-specific settings that are not covered by the standard Clipper command set.19 Its usage is key to enabling 256-color mode.

### **4.2 The HB\_GTI\_PALETTE Constant**

The hb\_gtInfo() function operates using a "selector" constant as its first argument, which tells the driver what feature to access. To manage the color palette, the relevant selector is HB\_GTI\_PALETTE. Harbour's changelogs and documentation confirm that the GTTRM driver was specifically updated to support this feature, making it the designated mechanism for 256-color control.20

The function call takes the form:  
hb\_gtInfo(HB\_GTI\_PALETTE, aPalette)  
When this line of code is executed, it does not simply "enable" 256-color mode. It performs a more powerful operation: it instructs the active GT driver (GTTRM, in this case) to completely redefine its internal color palette using the RGB definitions provided in the aPalette array. This gives the developer full control over the exact appearance of every color index from 0 to 255\.

### **4.3 Constructing the 256-Color Palette Array**

The second argument to hb\_gtInfo(HB\_GTI\_PALETTE,...) must be a properly structured Harbour array.22 This array serves as the definition for the entire 256-color palette.

The required structure is as follows:

* A main array containing exactly 256 elements (indexed 1 to 256 in Harbour).  
* Each element of the main array must itself be a sub-array containing three numeric values.  
* These three values represent the Red, Green, and Blue components for that color index, with each component ranging from 0 to 255\.

For example, to define color index 16 (the first color in the 6x6x6 cube, which is black) and color index 231 (the last color in the cube, which is white), the array would be populated like this:

Code snippet

// Note: Harbour arrays are 1-based, but the color palette is 0-based.  
// aPalette corresponds to color 0\.  
// aPalette corresponds to color 16\.  
aPalette := { 0, 0, 0 }       // Color 16 \= Black  
aPalette := { 255, 255, 255 } // Color 231 \= White

Manually defining all 256 colors is tedious and error-prone. The best practice is to create a function that programmatically generates the standard xterm 256-color palette based on the formulas and structures described in Section 1\.

### **4.4 Complete, Compilable Example (colors256.prg)**

### **4.5 Compilation and Execution**

To compile and run the example program, follow these steps precisely in a properly configured POSIX terminal:

1. **Save the Code:** Save the code above into a file named colors256.prg.  
2. **Set the Environment:** Ensure the $TERM variable is correctly set in your current shell session.  
   Bash  
   export TERM=xterm-256color

3. **Compile the Program:** Use hbmk2 with the \-gttrm flag to build the executable.  
   Bash  
   hbmk2 colors256.prg \-gttrm

4. **Run the Executable:** Execute the compiled program.

./colors256  
\`\`\`  
If all steps were followed correctly, the terminal will display a formatted grid of all 256 colors, confirming that the environment, the GTTRM driver, and the Harbour application are all working in concert.

## **Section 5: Advanced Techniques and Troubleshooting**

Even with a correct implementation, nuances in terminal behavior and platform differences can present challenges. This section covers common issues and explores the more advanced potential of the HB\_GTI\_PALETTE feature.

### **5.1 The setblink() Anomaly**

One of the most common and counter-intuitive issues when using GTTRM on Linux involves the display of the bright background colors (indices 8-15). In many terminal emulators, the ANSI sequence for "bold" or "increased intensity" is used to render these bright colors. The GTTRM driver's interpretation of Harbour's SETBLINK() command can affect this.

On POSIX systems using GTTRM, it is often necessary to enable blinking with SETBLINK(.T.) to make the bright background colors render correctly. Conversely, on Windows using the gtwin driver, SETBLINK(.F.) is required for the same effect. This platform-specific quirk means that portable code may need to include a conditional check to set this value appropriately based on the operating system.

Code snippet

// Example of OS-dependent setting  
IF "UNIX" $ OS()  
   SETBLINK(.T.)  
ELSE  
   SETBLINK(.F.)  
ENDIF

### **5.2 Troubleshooting Common Issues**

If the 256-color display does not work as expected, follow this diagnostic checklist, tracing the chain of dependencies from the environment down to the code.

1. **Verify the Environment First:** This is the most likely source of problems.  
   * Run echo $TERM. Does it output xterm-256color or screen-256color? If not, fix it according to the guides in Section 2\.  
   * Run tput colors. Does it output 256? If not, the system's terminfo database does not recognize your $TERM setting as 256-color capable.  
   * Run the simple shell-based color script from Section 2.4. Does it display all 256 colors? If not, the issue lies with the terminal emulator itself or its connection (e.g., SSH stripping control sequences), not with Harbour.  
2. **Check the Compilation Command:**  
   * Did you include the \-gttrm flag when running hbmk2? Without it, a different GT driver may have been linked, which will not behave as expected.  
3. **Review the Harbour Code:**  
   * Is the hbgtinfo.ch header file included?  
   * Is the palette array correctly structured? It must have exactly 256 elements, and each element must be a sub-array of three numbers. An off-by-one error in generation is a common mistake.  
   * Is hb\_gtInfo(HB\_GTI\_PALETTE, aPalette) being called *before* you attempt to display the colors?  
4. **Consider Multiplexers:**  
   * If running inside tmux, were you sure to launch it with tmux \-2 or have you configured default-terminal in .tmux.conf?. Running a nested terminal adds another layer that must be correctly configured.  
5. **Address Bright Color Issues:**  
   * If only the bright background colors (8-15) are failing to appear bright, have you tried toggling the SETBLINK() state as described above?.

### **5.3 Dynamic Palette Manipulation**

The hb\_gtInfo(HB\_GTI\_PALETTE,...) function is not a one-time setup call. It can be called at any point during the application's execution to redefine the entire color palette on the fly. This unlocks powerful capabilities for dynamic theming.

An application could be designed to:

* Load color theme definitions from an external .ini or .json file at startup.  
* Generate a palette array based on the selected theme.  
* Call hb\_gtInfo() to apply the theme.  
* Offer a settings menu that allows the user to switch between multiple themes (e.g., "Light," "Dark," "Solarized") in real-time. Each selection would trigger a new call to hb\_gtInfo() with a different palette array, instantly re-coloring the entire application interface without a restart.

This transforms the 256-color feature from a static display capability into a dynamic, user-configurable theming engine, allowing for the creation of highly polished and modern console applications with Harbour.

## **Conclusion**

Successfully displaying a 256-color ANSI/VT palette in a Harbour application using the GTTRM driver is an achievable goal that requires a methodical, multi-layered approach. It is not merely a matter of writing the correct Harbour code but of ensuring the entire technology stack, from the terminal emulator to the application runtime, is correctly configured and aligned.

The process can be summarized in four essential stages:

1. **Foundation:** Understand the discrete, indexed structure of the standard 256-color palette and the ANSI escape sequences that control it.  
2. **Environment:** Meticulously configure the terminal emulator, shell, and any multiplexers to correctly advertise 256-color support by setting the $TERM environment variable to xterm-256color or an equivalent. This is the most critical and often overlooked prerequisite.  
3. **Compilation:** Build the Harbour application using the hbmk2 tool, explicitly linking the dependency-free GTTRM driver with the \-gttrm switch.  
4. **Implementation:** Within the Harbour source code, programmatically generate an array defining the 256 RGB color values and use the hb\_gtInfo(HB\_GTI\_PALETTE,...) function to load this palette into the GT driver. Subsequently, use standard setColor() calls with numeric indices to render the desired colors.

By mastering both the external terminal environment and the internal Harbour GT API, developers can reliably move beyond the limitations of the classic 16-color console. This enables the creation of visually rich, modern, and highly portable command-line applications that stand out for their professional appearance and user-friendly interfaces.
