# **Root Cause Analysis: RDP Post-Authentication Hang at 'Please wait...' Screen**

## **I. Diagnostic Analysis: Deconstructing the RDP 'Please wait...' Hang**

### **A. Executive Summary of the Problem**

The described issue—a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection that successfully authenticates and then hangs indefinitely at the "Please wait..." screen—is a well-documented but complex problem. This analysis identifies the root cause not as a failure of authentication or initial connection, but as a **post-authentication session handoff failure**.

In this scenario, the RDP client, using Network Level Authentication (NLA), successfully negotiates a secure channel and validates the user's credentials with the remote host.1 The hang occurs in the subsequent phase: the Remote Desktop Services (TermService) on the host machine attempts to attach the newly authenticated connection to the user's pre-existing, non-responsive session. This "stuck" or "zombie" session, often left over from a previous, ungraceful disconnect, fails to acknowledge the handoff, leaving the client in a waiting state.1 The remote machine requires a forced reboot to clear this hung session state, which is a disruptive and unsustainable operational workaround.

### **B. Symptom Triangulation**

A precise diagnosis is possible by triangulating the specific symptoms and environmental factors:

* **The Trigger:** This hang is most frequently reported on domain-joined Windows systems, particularly Windows 10 and Windows Server editions.4 The problem is not constant but intermittent, and it is strongly correlated with an improper or ungraceful RDP session disconnect.4 The most commonly cited trigger is a user connecting via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and then closing their client laptop lid. This action puts the client machine to sleep, which abruptly severs both the RDP and VPN connections without a proper logoff sequence.4  
* **The State:** This ungraceful disconnect leaves the user's session in a "stuck" or "zombie" state on the remote host. The session is not fully logged off, but its internal processes (particularly network-aware services) may be in an unrecoverable, deadlocked state.4  
* **The Failure Point:** The default-configured Microsoft RDP client (MSTSC.exe) is designed to enhance user experience by automatically reconnecting to a user's existing session if one is found. When the user attempts to log in again, the NLA/Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) mechanism authenticates them and identifies this pre-existing "zombie" session. The RDP service on the host then attempts to hand the new connection over to this session. The handoff fails because the session is non-responsive, and the client is left waiting indefinitely at the last-received screen: "Please wait...".5  
* **The Admin Override:** The fact that a different user, such as an administrator, can successfully log in to the same machine (with their *own* credentials) and then remotely log off the stuck user or reboot the machine confirms a critical diagnostic point.4 The RDP listener (port 3389\) and the core Remote Desktop Services are functioning correctly.7 The problem is not a system-wide crash but a user-specific, session-level deadlock.

### **C. Differentiating from Other Common RDP Failures**

This "Please wait..." hang must be diagnostically distinguished from other common RDP issues to avoid incorrect troubleshooting paths:

* **RDP "Black Screen of Death":** A black screen *after* login is typically caused by a mismatch in screen caching (Bitmap Caching) or display driver/resolution conflicts.8 This is a post-logon rendering failure, whereas the "Please wait..." issue is a pre-logon session handoff failure.  
* **"Welcome" Screen Hang:** A hang at the "Welcome" screen is a related but distinct phase of the logon process, occurring *after* the "Please wait..." screen and typically involving the User Profile Service loading the user's profile.9  
* **Connection Failure Error:** The user is *not* experiencing a connection failure. The RDP connection is established, security is negotiated, and authentication is successful *before* the hang occurs. This rules out network-level blocks or simple credential failures.

The success of the user's workaround (enablecredsspsupport:i:0) is the key piece of evidence. This parameter disables CredSSP 10, which in turn bypasses the NLA-based *reconnection* logic.5 It forces the RDP client to request a completely *new* session, which manifests as the standard Windows login prompt.4 Similarly, third-party RDP clients (like aFreeRDP) that do not implement the same reconnection logic and force a new session by connecting as "Other User" are also reported to bypass this hang.4

This confirms the diagnostic conclusion: the problem is not the *connection* or *authentication*, but the *reconnection* to a pre-existing, hung session. The workarounds "fix" the problem by avoiding this reconnection attempt entirely.

## **II. The enablecredsspsupport:i:0 Workaround: Mechanism and Consequence**

The user's identified workaround, adding the enablecredsspsupport:i:0 line to the .rdp file, is a client-side directive that fundamentally changes the RDP connection's security and authentication protocol. Understanding its mechanism reveals precisely why it circumvents the hang and also why it is an "inconvenient" and insecure solution.

### **A. Technical Breakdown of the RDP Parameter**

The Remote Desktop client can be configured via settings in a .rdp file.13

* **enablecredsspsupport**: This parameter line dictates whether the RDP client will attempt to use the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol for authentication.10  
* **:i:0**: This value is an integer flag set to 0 (False). It explicitly instructs the client *not* to use CredSSP, even if the local operating system supports it.10 The default value, which is implicitly used when the line is absent, is :i:1 (True).11

### **B. The Link Between CredSSP and Network Level Authentication (NLA)**

The function of CredSSP is inextricably linked to Network Level Authentication (NLA), a critical security feature of modern RDP.

* **NLA Function:** NLA requires the user to authenticate to the RDP server *before* the server allocates the resources for a full remote session (i.e., before the login screen is ever shown).16 This provides a robust defense against brute-force password attacks and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, as unauthenticated users cannot consume server session resources.16  
* **CredSSP's Role:** CredSSP is the *enabling protocol* for NLA. It is the Security Support Provider (SSP) that securely encrypts and delegates the user's client-side credentials (or a single sign-on token) to the remote server for this pre-session authentication check.16

Therefore, a direct causal link exists: NLA *requires* CredSSP to function. By setting enablecredsspsupport:i:0, the RDP client is effectively declaring, "I will not use CredSSP." This makes the client non-compliant with any server that *requires* NLA. If a client with this setting attempts to connect to a server where NLA is mandatory, the connection will be rejected immediately with an error stating, "The remote computer requires Network Level Authentication, which your computer does not support".12

### **C. Why This "Fixes" the Hang (And Why It's "Inconvenient")**

The fact that this workaround functions implies the user has also disabled the "Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication" setting on the remote server's System Properties.1

* **The Mechanism:** As established, the CredSSP/NLA protocol stack is responsible for both seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) and session reconnection.5 By disabling this entire stack on both the client (with :i:0) and the server (by unchecking the NLA box), the RDP connection reverts to an older, less secure behavior. The client no longer attempts to find and reconnect to the "zombie" session. Instead, it establishes a basic connection, and the server immediately presents the standard Windows logon screen. This forces the user to manually create a *new* session, completely bypassing the "zombie" session and thus avoiding the hang.4  
* **The "Inconvenience":** The user's term "inconvenient" is a direct reference to the loss of SSO.18 With CredSSP disabled, the client cannot delegate the user's local credentials. The user must now manually type their username and password at the remote login prompt for *every single connection*.12 In a domain environment where users expect seamless access, this is a significant degradation of workflow.

### **D. The Security Implications (The Unstated Risk)**

The "inconvenience" is secondary to the significant security risk introduced by this workaround. Disabling NLA on the remote server is explicitly "not recommended" by Microsoft and security professionals.12

* **Increased Attack Surface:** With NLA disabled, *any* unauthenticated attacker on the network can establish a full RDP session, consuming server-side CPU and RAM resources just to reach the login screen.16  
* **Vulnerability to DoS and Brute-Force Attacks:** This resource consumption exposes the server to DoS attacks, where an attacker can exhaust server resources by initiating thousands of sessions. More critically, it enables attackers to perform traditional RDP brute-force password-guessing attacks directly against the logon screen, an attack vector that NLA was specifically designed to eliminate.16

The user's action (disabling CredSSP) "fixed" the hang, leading to the logical but incorrect conclusion that CredSSP was the *cause* of the problem. In reality, CredSSP's session-reconnection feature was merely the *messenger* that was failing to deliver a message to a *dead recipient* (the zombie session). The user's workaround shoots the messenger. A proper solution must address the "dead recipient" on the server.

## **III. Differential Diagnosis: Eliminating the CredSSP "Encryption Oracle" Fallacy**

When troubleshooting RDP failures involving CredSSP, it is critical to differentiate the user's "post-authentication hang" from a much more common, but distinct, issue: the "CredSSP Encryption Oracle Remediation" error. A failure to differentiate these two problems will lead to incorrect and ineffective troubleshooting.

### **A. Identifying the "Red Herring"**

A significant number of RDP failures since 2018 are a result of security patches for a remote code execution vulnerability in CredSSP, tracked as CVE-2018-0886.21 The patches and subsequent Group Policy changes are collectively known as the "Encryption Oracle Remediation".24 Googling "RDP CredSSP error" will almost exclusively lead to solutions for this specific, unrelated problem.

### **B. The "Encryption Oracle" Failure Mechanism**

The remediation for CVE-2018-0886 involved patching both RDP clients and servers. Microsoft then updated the default Group Policy settings to enforce these patches.28 A failure occurs when there is a *patch mismatch*. The most common scenario is a fully patched RDP client (set to "Mitigated" or "Force updated clients") attempting to connect to an unpatched RDP server (still "Vulnerable").27 The client's security policy blocks the insecure connection.

### **C. The Critical Diagnostic Differentiator (The "Why it's NOT your problem")**

The key difference lies in the *symptom*:

* **The "Encryption Oracle" Symptom:** This issue produces an immediate and explicit **connection failure error** *before* any "Please wait..." screen is shown. The error message is unambiguous: "An authentication error has occurred.... This could be due to CredSSP encryption oracle remediation.".23  
* **The User's Symptom:** The user is *not* receiving this error. Their authentication is *succeeding*, and they are *hanging* at the "Please wait..." screen *after* authentication is complete.1

This distinction is absolute. The user's problem is *not* related to CVE-2018-0886. Therefore, any troubleshooting steps related to this vulnerability—such as applying patches 23, modifying the AllowEncryptionOracle registry key 28, or changing the "Encryption Oracle Remediation" Group Policy setting 20—will have no effect on the "Please wait..." hang and should be avoided.

The following table provides a clear diagnostic summary.

### **Table 1: Diagnostic Differentiator: Connection Failure vs. Post-Authentication Hang**

| Symptom | User's Issue ("Please wait..." Hang) | "Encryption Oracle" Mismatch (CVE-2018-0886) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Failure Point** | Post-authentication (Session Initialization / Handoff) 1 | Pre-authentication (Protocol Negotiation) \[27, 28\] |
| **Observed Behavior** | Indefinite hang at "Please wait..." screen 1 | Immediate connection failure and error dialog \[24, 26\] |
| **Error Message** | None. The client simply waits. | "An authentication error has occurred... CredSSP encryption oracle remediation." \[23, 28\] |
| **Root Cause** | Stuck user session ("zombie" session) on the host machine 5 | Security patch mismatch between RDP client and server 27 |
| **Symptomatic Fix** | Disabling CredSSP/NLA (enablecredsspsupport:i:0) \[10, 12\] | Setting "Encryption Oracle Remediation" GPO to "Vulnerable" \[20, 24, 31\] |

## **IV. Root Cause Identification: The "Stuck Session" Deadlock**

With the "Encryption Oracle" fallacy eliminated, the analysis can focus on the true root cause: the creation of the "zombie session" on the host machine. The generic "Please wait..." screen is a mask for a deadlocked service *within* the user's disconnected session. The two most common culprits for this deadlock are the Group Policy Client and the User Profile Service.

### **A. The Proximate Cause: The "Zombie Session" Handoff Failure**

As established, the hang is a direct result of the RDP client, using NLA/CredSSP, attempting to reconnect to a user's pre-existing, hung session.5 This session is in a "zombie" state due to an abrupt, ungraceful disconnect, such as a VPN drop or the client laptop being put to sleep.4 The core question is *why* this session becomes a "zombie" instead of simply logging off. The answer lies in services that are dependent on the network connection that was just severed.

### **B. The Deeper Cause (1): Group Policy Client (GPSVC) Deadlock**

In many cases, the "Please wait..." screen is a generic front-end for a more specific message that is not being passed to the client: "Please wait for the Group Policy Client".33

* **Mechanism:** The Group Policy Client service (gpsvc) is a fundamental Windows service that runs at logon (and reconnect) to apply user-level Group Policy Objects (GPOs). To do this, it *must* communicate with a Domain Controller (DC).33  
* **Failure Scenario (The VPN/DC Trap):** This is the most likely scenario for the user's problem.  
  1. A user connects to their corporate network via VPN.  
  2. They initiate an RDP session to their domain-joined machine. Their session is now "domain-aware" and has a live connection to a DC.  
  3. An event, such as a logon script or a background policy refresh, is initiated by the gpsvc service.  
  4. The VPN connection drops ungracefully (e.g., laptop sleep, network loss).37  
  5. The user's disconnected RDP session is now running "orphaned" on the host machine. It has *lost its network path to the Domain Controller*.  
  6. The gpsvc service, which was in the middle of a GPO process, is now in a deadlocked state. It is stuck in an endless retry loop, waiting for a network response from a DC that is, from its perspective, in a black hole.34 The gpupdate /force command will also time out if run in this state.34  
  7. When the user reconnects, the RDP service (TermService) authenticates them and attempts to hand the new connection to this "zombie" session. The handoff fails because the session is completely locked, waiting for gpsvc to time out (which it may never do).

### **C. The Deeper Cause (2): User Profile Service (ProfSvc) Deadlock**

The other common, and related, deadlock involves the User Profile Service. In this case, the hidden message is "Please wait for the User Profile Service".9

* **Known Mechanism:** This is a well-documented deadlock in Windows, occurring between three specific components: the **Credential Manager**, the **Data Protection API (DPAPI)**, and the **Redirector (RDR)** (which handles network paths).9  
* **Failure Scenario (The DFS/Password Trap):**  
  1. This deadlock is frequently triggered when a user's profile has dependencies on network resources, such as a mapped home folder or roaming profile stored on a Distributed File System (DFS) path.9  
  2. It can also be triggered after a user's domain password has changed, causing a mismatch between the user's current password and the credentials cached by the Credential Manager.9  
  3. The failure pattern is identical to the gpsvc issue: the user is connected via VPN/RDP. The VPN drops. The user's disconnected session, now orphaned, attempts to access a network-dependent profile path (e.g., \\\\contoso.com\\homefolders\\user).9 The RDR and DPAPI components deadlock while trying to authenticate to this path without a valid network connection or with mismatched cached credentials. This creates the "zombie" session.  
  4. Corrupted user profiles 33 or even a full temporary files folder 44 can also cause the User Profile Service to fail to load, contributing to a similar hang.

In summary, the user's problem is a "zombie session" phenomenon caused by a three-way interaction:

1. **Trigger:** An unstable network state (VPN/sleep).4  
2. **Primary Failure:** An abrupt network loss causes a *service within the user's disconnected session* (like gpsvc or profsvc) to enter a deadlocked state, endlessly retrying a network call to a resource (DC, DFS path) that has vanished.9  
3. **Secondary Failure:** The user reconnects. The RDP protocol's NLA/CredSSP mechanism *correctly* authenticates them and identifies their existing "zombie" session.5  
4. **Result (The Hang):** The RDP service attempts to hand the new connection to this zombie session. The session, being deadlocked, never acknowledges the handoff. The user's client is left waiting indefinitely at the "Please wait..." screen.

## **V. Triage and Resolution Strategies (The "Another Solution")**

The user's request for "another solution" can be broken into two parts: an immediate, less-disruptive workaround (triage) and a set of permanent, secure fixes that address the root cause. A full reboot of the remote machine is a blunt instrument; the following methods are the surgical, professional-grade alternatives.

### **A. Immediate Triage (The "Better Workaround"): Remotely Resetting the Stuck Session**

Instead of rebooting the entire remote machine, the "zombie" session can be terminated remotely. This resolves the problem in seconds with no collateral damage to other users or services on that machine.

* **Prerequisites:** This method requires two things:  
  1. Administrative credentials on the remote machine.  
  2. Network access to the remote machine from a separate, working computer (e.g., an administrator's workstation).  
     You must have "Full Control" access permission to reset another user's session.45  
* **Step 1: Identify the Stuck Session (Command Line)**  
  * From an *administrative* Command Prompt or PowerShell terminal on your local workstation, run the query user command (or its older alias qwinsta).  
  * **Syntax:** query user /server:\<REMOTE\_MACHINE\_NAME\>  
  * **Example:** query user /server:WKSTN-017 4  
  * This will return a list of all sessions on the remote computer. Look for the problematic user's session. The STATE will likely be Disc (Disconnected).47 Note the numeric ID (e.g., 2\) for this session.50  
* **Step 2: Terminate the Stuck Session (Command Line)**  
  * In the same administrative terminal, run the reset session command (or its older alias rwinsta).  
  * **Syntax:** reset session \<ID\> /server:\<REMOTE\_MACHINE\_NAME\>  
  * **Example:** reset session 2 /server:WKSTN-017 4  
  * This command forcefully terminates the "zombie" session and all its processes on the remote machine, effectively "killing" the deadlock.  
* **Step 3: Reconnect**  
  * The affected user can now immediately RDP to the remote machine as normal. Since their "zombie" session has been removed, the RDP service will create a new, clean session for them, and the logon will proceed.  
* **Alternative Triage (Graphical Interface)**  
  * If you can RDP to the remote machine as a *different user* (e.g., using your own administrative account), log in normally.3  
  * Once on the remote desktop, right-click the taskbar and open **Task Manager**.  
  * Click the **"Users"** tab.  
  * You will see the stuck user in the list (their status may be "Disconnected").  
  * Right-click the problematic user's name and select **"Log off"**.2 This achieves the same result as the reset session command.

### **B. Permanent Fix 1: Mitigating Session Management Conflicts (GPO)**

This Group Policy-based solution addresses the session handoff failure by enforcing a stricter session management model.

* **Policy:** Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session.4  
* **GPO Path:** Computer Configuration \> Administrative Templates \> Windows Components \> Remote Desktop Services \> Remote Desktop Session Host \> Connections.4  
* **Recommended Setting:** Enabled.4  
* Mechanism Explained: The root of the problem is a conflict in how the RDP service's reconnection logic handles a pre-existing, hung session. When this policy is "Disabled" or "Not Configured," the system may allow a user to create unlimited simultaneous remote connections, which introduces logical complexity.55  
  By setting this policy to Enabled, you enforce a strict one-to-one mapping: one user is allowed only one session on that server (whether active or disconnected).55 If the user disconnects, the RDP service knows it must reconnect them to that specific session at their next logon. This strict enforcement simplifies the session handoff logic, making it more robust. It appears to prevent the RDP service from getting "confused" by the "zombie" session, allowing it to be properly terminated and replaced by the new login. This GPO change has been widely reported by system administrators as a successful and permanent fix for the "Please wait..." hang.4

### **C. Permanent Fix 2: Stabilizing RDP Network Detection (GPO)**

This Group Policy-based solution addresses the *trigger* of the "zombie" session: the network instability itself.

* **Policy:** Select network detection on the server.2  
* **GPO Path:** Computer Configuration \> Administrative Templates \> Windows Components \> Remote Desktop Services \> Remote Desktop Session Host \> Connections.5  
* **Recommended Setting:** Enabled  
  * **Sub-option Select Network Detect Level:** Turn off Connect Time Detect and Continuous Network Detect.5  
* Mechanism Explained: The trigger for the zombie session is the abrupt network loss (VPN/sleep).4 By default, the RDP protocol is a complex, stateful protocol. It constantly monitors network quality using "Connect Time Detect" (a check during connection) and "Continuous Network Detect" (ongoing monitoring) to dynamically adapt the user experience (e.g., changing compression, graphics quality, etc.).59  
  This "Continuous Network Detect" process is fragile. When the underlying network (VPN) drops abruptly, this detection mechanism itself can fail, hang, or deadlock, contributing to the "zombie" state of the session.  
  By enabling this GPO and explicitly turning off these detection features, the RDP connection becomes "dumber" and more robust. It stops trying to adapt to network changes and instead assumes a low-speed connection.59 This simpler, less-adaptive protocol is far less likely to deadlock when faced with the exact network instability that is causing the user's problem. This is a classic engineering trade-off: sacrificing optimal performance for maximum stability and reliability.

### **Table 2: Summary of Recommended Group Policy Solutions**

The following settings should be applied via GPO (or gpedit.msc for a single machine) to the *remote host computers* that are experiencing the hang.

| Policy Name | GPO Path | Recommended Setting | Corrective Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session** 4 | ... \> Windows Components \> Remote Desktop Services \> Remote Desktop Session Host \> Connections 4 | Enabled \[4, 58\] | Enforces a strict 1:1 user-to-session mapping, simplifying the session handoff logic and preventing reconnection conflicts. |
| **Select network detection on the server** 5 | ... \> Windows Components \> Remote Desktop Services \> Remote Desktop Session Host \> Connections 5 | Enabled **Sub-option:** Turn off Connect Time Detect and Continuous Network Detect 5 | Disables dynamic network quality adaptation. This prevents the RDP protocol itself from deadlocking during network instability (e.g., VPN drops).59 |

## **VI. Concluding Analysis and Recommended Configuration**

### **A. Final Diagnosis Synthesis**

The RDP hang at "Please wait..." is a post-authentication session handoff failure. It is caused by the RDP client, using NLA/CredSSP, attempting to reconnect to a "zombie" user session on the host machine. This session is in a deadlocked state, most often because a core, network-dependent service like the **Group Policy Client (GPSVC)** 33 or **User Profile Service (ProfSvc)** 9 has hung. This deadlock is triggered when the service attempts to contact a domain resource (like a Domain Controller or DFS path) after an abrupt, ungraceful network disconnect (e.g., a VPN drop or client laptop sleep event).4

### **B. On the enablecredsspsupport:i:0 Workaround**

The user's current workaround of enablecredsspsupport:i:0 is operationally and insecure. It "fixes" the problem by masking the symptom: it bypasses the session reconnection logic by disabling CredSSP/NLA, thereby *ignoring* the stuck session instead of resolving it. This requires disabling NLA on the server, which introduces a significant security vulnerability by exposing the server to Denial-of-Service and brute-force attacks.12 This workaround should be reverted.

### **C. Recommended Multi-Tiered Solution**

A robust, permanent, and secure solution involves addressing both the immediate symptom and the underlying root causes.

1. **Immediate Triage:** For any currently stuck user, an administrator should use the query user /server:\<name\> 49 and reset session \<id\> /server:\<name\> 51 commands from an administrative prompt. This surgically terminates the hung session, restoring access for the user in seconds without requiring a full system reboot.  
2. **Primary Permanent Fix:** Implement the Group Policy setting **Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session** and set it to Enabled on the affected host machines.4 This directly addresses the session management conflict that leads to the handoff failure.  
3. **Secondary Hardening Fix:** Implement the Group Policy setting **Select network detection on the server**, set it to Enabled, and set its sub-option to **Turn off Connect Time Detect and Continuous Network Detect**.5 This hardens the RDP connection against the network instability (VPNs, etc.) that *triggers* the service deadlock in the first place.

### **D. Concluding Remark**

By implementing these two Group Policy changes on the affected host machines, the underlying causes of the session deadlock—both the session management conflict and the protocol's fragility to network drops—are addressed. This provides a robust, secure, and permanent solution that eliminates the need for disruptive reboots. These changes will allow enablecredsspsupport:i:0 to be removed and Network Level Authentication to be re-enabled, restoring both the security and the single sign-on convenience of the modern Remote Desktop experience.
