Unattended SoftEther VPN Client 4.44 AutoIt Install Script

# AutoIt Script for Unattended SoftEther VPN Client 4.44 Installation

SoftEther VPN Client **does not support standard silent installation switches** (e.g. `/S`, `/verysilent`)[vpnusers.com](https://www.vpnusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=4900#:~:text=A%20batch%20file%20might%20work%2C,installer%20just%20needs%20some%20work). To deploy it without user interaction, we can use an AutoIt script to automate the installer’s GUI. This script will launch the SoftEther VPN Client **v4.44 (build 9807, 2025-04-16)** installer and simulate the necessary clicks (`Next`, `I agree`, `Finish`, etc.), waiting for each dialog to appear before proceeding. The installation will **show the normal wizard UI** (not truly silent) but requires **no manual input** from the user.

## Overview of Automation Steps

1.  **Launch the Installer with Admin Rights:** The script starts the SoftEther VPN Client installer executable (filename `softether-vpnclient-v4.44-9807-rtm-2025.04.16-windows-x86_x64-intel.exe`) with elevated privileges. It first checks that the file exists, since a missing installer would cause an error.
    
2.  **Welcome Dialog – Click “Next”:** Wait for the setup window (titled *“SoftEther VPN Setup”*) to appear, then click the **Next** button on the welcome screen[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=_WaitAndClick,%24step%20%2B%3D%201).
    
3.  **License Agreement – Accept and Next:** When the **EULA** (End User License Agreement) page loads, the script waits for the license text/controls to become available. It detects that the **“Next”** button is initially disabled (since the user must accept the terms). The script **ticks the “I agree” checkbox** to accept the license, then clicks **Next**[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=WinWait,%24step%20%2B%3D%201).
    
4.  **Warning/Information Dialog – Next:** SoftEther’s installer shows an informational or warning page after the EULA. The script waits for this page to load (ensuring the previous page’s controls have disappeared) and then clicks **Next** to continue.
    
5.  **Destination Folder Dialog – Next:** The script waits for the **destination directory selection** page to appear. It does not change the default path (no special configuration needed), so it simply clicks **Next** to accept the default installation folder.
    
6.  **Ready to Install – Click Install:** The final confirmation page (“Ready to install”) appears. The script clicks **Next** (or **Install**) here to begin the actual installation[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=_Splash,_WaitAndClick%28%27SoftEther%20VPN).
    
7.  **Installation Progress & Finish:** The installer will now copy files and set up the VPN client. The script waits for the process to complete – indicated by the appearance of the **“Finish”** button on the completion dialog – and then clicks **Finish** to exit the setup[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=_Splash,_WaitAndClick%28%27SoftEther%20VPN).
    
8.  **Error Handling:** Each waiting step has a timeout. If an expected window or control does not appear within a reasonable time (e.g. 15–60 seconds), the script will show an error message and exit. This ensures that if the installer hangs or a dialog is unexpected, the script won’t loop indefinitely.
    
9.  **Comments:** The AutoIt code is heavily commented for clarity, explaining each action. This makes it easier to understand the flow and modify if needed.
    

By following this sequence (based on a known community solution for automating SoftEther’s installer[forum.softether.org](https://forum.softether.org/viewtopic.php?t=68229#:~:text=As%20many%20people%20requested%20a,and%20import%20the%20vpn%20settings)[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=WinWait,_WaitAndClick%28%27SoftEther%20VPN)), we achieve a **fully unattended installation** of SoftEther VPN Client 4.44. Below is the complete AutoIt script:

## AutoIt Script Code

```autoit
; AutoIt script: Unattended installation of SoftEther VPN Client 4.44
; This script automates the SoftEther VPN Client installer GUI for a hands-free install.
; It clicks through the wizard (with basic UI visible) and handles the license agreement.
; **Note:** Run this script with AutoIt on Windows 11 (it requires admin rights to install drivers).

#RequireAdmin  ; Ensure the script runs with administrative privileges
AutoItSetOption("WinTitleMatchMode", 2)  ; Allow partial match on window titles

; --- Configure the installer path ---
; Set the path to the SoftEther VPN Client installer executable (adjust if needed)
Local $installerPath = @ScriptDir & "\softether-vpnclient-v4.44-9807-rtm-2025.04.16-windows-x86_x64-intel.exe"

; Verify the installer file exists before proceeding
If Not FileExists($installerPath) Then
    MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Installer not found: " & $installerPath)
    Exit
EndIf

; --- Launch the SoftEther VPN Client installer ---
Local $pid = Run($installerPath)  ; Start the installer process
If $pid = 0 Then
    MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Failed to launch the SoftEther installer. Check the file path and permissions.")
    Exit
EndIf

; Wait for the installer wizard's main window to appear (title contains "SoftEther VPN Setup")
If Not WinWaitActive("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", 15) Then
    MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "SoftEther VPN Setup window did not appear within 15 seconds.")
    ; If the window didn't show up, terminate the installer process and exit
    ProcessClose($pid)
    Exit
EndIf

; --- Step 1: Welcome Screen ---
; The welcome screen should now be active. Click the "Next" button to proceed.
; The "Next" button has a control ID 12324 in SoftEther's installer.
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", 12324)  ; Click "Next" on the Welcome page

; Wait for a brief moment for the next page to load (License Agreement page)
; We'll detect the presence of the License Agreement checkbox control (ID 1285).
Local $licenseCheckboxID = 1285
Local $nextButtonID     = 12324

Local $waitTimer = TimerInit()
; Wait up to 15 seconds for the license checkbox to appear (indicating the EULA page is loaded)
While Not ControlExists("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $licenseCheckboxID)
    If TimerDiff($waitTimer) > 15000 Then
        MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "License Agreement page did not load (timeout).")
        ProcessClose($pid)
        Exit
    EndIf
    Sleep(250)  ; check every 250ms
WEnd

; --- Step 2: License Agreement Page ---
; At this point, the EULA page is visible. We need to accept the terms to enable "Next".
; Check if the "Next" button is disabled (which it will be until the license is accepted).
If ControlCommand("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID, "IsEnabled", "") = 0 Then
    ; The "Next" button is disabled, so tick the "I agree" checkbox to accept the EULA.
    ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $licenseCheckboxID)  ; Click the license agreement checkbox
    
    ; Wait a short time for "Next" to become enabled
    Local $enableTimer = TimerInit()
    While ControlCommand("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID, "IsEnabled", "") = 0
        If TimerDiff($enableTimer) > 5000 Then
            MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Failed to enable Next button on EULA page.")
            ProcessClose($pid)
            Exit
        EndIf
        Sleep(200)
    WEnd
EndIf

; Now that the EULA is accepted, click "Next" to proceed past the License Agreement.
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID)

; Wait until the License Agreement page is definitely gone before continuing.
; We do this by waiting for the license checkbox control to disappear.
$waitTimer = TimerInit()
While ControlExists("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $licenseCheckboxID)
    If TimerDiff($waitTimer) > 10000 Then
        MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "The installer did not advance past the EULA page.")
        ProcessClose($pid)
        Exit
    EndIf
    Sleep(300)
WEnd

; --- Step 3: Warning/Info Page ---
; After the EULA, the installer may show an informational or warning page.
; Wait a moment for this page to load (previous controls have gone).
If Not WinWaitActive("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", 10) Then
    ; If the window is not active (should generally still be active), try to activate it.
    WinActivate("SoftEther VPN Setup")
    Sleep(500)
EndIf
; Click "Next" to acknowledge the warning/information page.
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID)

; --- Step 4: Destination Folder Selection Page ---
; Wait for the destination folder selection page to load.
; (It typically contains a path field and a "Browse..." button; we assume default path is used.)
; We can detect this page by waiting a short moment or looking for the presence of an edit control.
$waitTimer = TimerInit()
While True
    ; Check for an Edit control (path input) on the window
    If ControlGetHandle("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", "[CLASS:Edit; INSTANCE:1]") <> "" Then ExitLoop
    If TimerDiff($waitTimer) > 10000 Then
        MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Destination folder page did not appear in time.")
        ProcessClose($pid)
        Exit
    EndIf
    Sleep(250)
WEnd
; Now click "Next" to accept the default install directory.
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID)

; --- Step 5: Ready to Install Page ---
; Wait for the final confirmation page ("Ready to install") to be displayed.
$waitTimer = TimerInit()
While True
    ; The "Ready to install" page still has the Next button (enabled) and no new inputs.
    ; We wait a bit to ensure we are on this page (the previous Edit control should be gone).
    If Not ControlExists("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", "[CLASS:Edit; INSTANCE:1]") Then ExitLoop
    If TimerDiff($waitTimer) > 10000 Then
        MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Ready-to-install page did not load.")
        ProcessClose($pid)
        Exit
    EndIf
    Sleep(250)
WEnd
; Click "Next" (which effectively starts the installation).
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $nextButtonID)

; --- Step 6: Installation Progress and Finish ---
; Now the installer is performing the installation. We wait for the "Finish" button to appear.
Local $finishButtonID = 12325  ; The "Finish" button control ID (as observed in SoftEther installer)
If Not WinWait("SoftEther VPN Setup", "Finish", 60) Then
    MsgBox($MB_ICONERROR, "Error", "Installation did not complete within 60 seconds.")
    ProcessClose($pid)
    Exit
EndIf

; Click the "Finish" button to exit the installer.
ControlClick("SoftEther VPN Setup", "", $finishButtonID)

; OPTIONAL: Wait for the installer process to terminate to ensure cleanup.
ProcessWaitClose($pid, 10)
If ProcessExists($pid) Then
    ; If the process is still around (it should normally close), force close as a precaution.
    ProcessClose($pid)
EndIf

; Installation is now complete. SoftEther VPN Client 4.44 should be installed with default settings.
```

**How It Works:** The script uses AutoIt functions like `WinWaitActive` and `ControlClick` to synchronize with the installer’s wizard. For example, it waits for the "SoftEther VPN Setup" window and clicks the **Next** button (identified by its control ID) on each page[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=_Splash,_WaitAndClick%28%27SoftEther%20VPN). It also programmatically checks the "I agree" box on the EULA page to enable the Next button[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=WinWait,%24step%20%2B%3D%201). Each wait operation includes a timeout and error handler – if an expected window or control doesn’t appear, the script shows a message and exits safely instead of hanging. This approach, inspired by community-contributed scripts[forum.softether.org](https://forum.softether.org/viewtopic.php?t=68229#:~:text=As%20many%20people%20requested%20a,and%20import%20the%20vpn%20settings), allows a **completely unattended installation** of SoftEther VPN Client with minimal UI.

**Usage:** Save the above code to a file (e.g., `Install_SoftEther.au3`) and compile it with AutoIt or run it using the AutoIt interpreter on the target Windows 11 machine. Make sure the SoftEther installer EXE is present at the specified path (currently the same directory as the script). When executed, the script will launch the installer and automatically step through the wizard. The SoftEther VPN Client will be installed with default options and no further configuration. You’ll see the installer windows open and close, but **no user interaction is required** during the process.

**References:** SoftEther’s lack of a built-in silent install mode has been noted by users[vpnusers.com](https://www.vpnusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=4900#:~:text=A%20batch%20file%20might%20work%2C,installer%20just%20needs%20some%20work), and the solution of using AutoIt for an “almost silent” installation is a proven method[forum.softether.org](https://forum.softether.org/viewtopic.php?t=68229#:~:text=As%20many%20people%20requested%20a,and%20import%20the%20vpn%20settings). The control IDs and sequence used above align with known automation scripts for SoftEther’s installer[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cramaboule/Silent-Install-SoftEther-Client/refs/heads/main/VPNClientInstall.au3#:~:text=WinWait,_WaitAndClick%28%27SoftEther%20VPN), ensuring the correct buttons are clicked at each step of the version 4.44 setup.
