# **A Comprehensive Guide to Certificate Authentication in SoftEther VPN: Implementation and Version Analysis**

## **Part 1: Foundational Principles of PKI-Based VPN Authentication**

In modern network security, the transition from password-based authentication to more robust cryptographic methods is a critical step in mitigating risk. SoftEther VPN, a versatile multi-protocol VPN solution, provides comprehensive support for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) through certificate-based authentication. This method replaces shared secrets (passwords) with asymmetric cryptography, offering superior security, scalability, and manageability. Understanding the foundational principles of PKI is essential for correctly implementing and maintaining a secure SoftEther VPN environment. This section delineates the core concepts of the chain of trust, the distinct roles of server and client authentication, and the components of a SoftEther-centric PKI.

### **1.1 The Role of Certificates in Establishing a Chain of Trust**

Public Key Infrastructure is a framework of policies, standards, and systems used to create, manage, distribute, and revoke digital certificates. At its heart, PKI leverages asymmetric cryptography, which involves a mathematically linked pair of keys for each entity: a public key, which can be shared widely, and a private key, which must be kept secret. The security of the system relies on the fact that data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key, and a digital signature created with a private key can be verified by anyone with the corresponding public key.

In the context of a VPN, this principle is used to establish identity and trust. Instead of a user proving their identity by presenting a password that the server also knows, the user's client software performs a cryptographic operation (such as signing a piece of challenge data) using its private key. The server then uses the client's public certificate to verify this signature. A successful verification proves that the client is in possession of the correct private key, thus authenticating the user without ever transmitting a secret over the network.1

This model is inherently more secure than password-based authentication. Passwords can be guessed, phished, or compromised through brute-force attacks. A private key, especially a long one (e.g., 4096-bit RSA), is computationally infeasible to guess. SoftEther's own documentation recommends certificate authentication in any environment where corporate security policy demands a higher level of assurance than passwords can provide.1 This establishes a chain of trust: the server trusts the certificate, and by extension, trusts the entity that possesses the corresponding private key.

### **1.2 Distinguishing Server Authentication from Client Authentication**

A secure VPN tunnel relies on mutual authentication, a two-way process where both the client and the server verify each other's identity. These two components, server authentication and client authentication, are distinct but complementary functions within the SoftEther architecture.

**Server Authentication:** This is the process by which the VPN client verifies the identity of the VPN server. It is a critical defense against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. In such an attack, a malicious actor intercepts the connection attempt and presents a phony server to the client. Without server authentication, the client might unknowingly connect to this malicious server, allowing the attacker to decrypt, inspect, or modify all traffic.3 To prevent this, the SoftEther VPN Server presents its X.509 server certificate to the client during the initial connection handshake. The client examines this certificate to determine if the server is authentic and trustworthy. If the certificate is invalid, expired, or not trusted by the client, the connection is terminated, thwarting the attack.3

**Client Authentication:** This is the process by which the VPN server verifies the identity of the connecting user or device. This is the primary mechanism for access control. After the server has proven its identity to the client, the client must prove its identity to the server. The client presents its unique X.509 client certificate and proves possession of the corresponding private key. The server checks the presented certificate against its configured user database to determine if that user is authorized to connect.1 This is the core focus of this report and the mechanism that replaces traditional username/password logins.

Together, these two processes ensure that a legitimate client is connecting to a legitimate server, establishing a fully authenticated and secure communication channel.

### **1.3 Anatomy of a SoftEther PKI: CA, Server, and Client Certificates**

A functional PKI within SoftEther consists of three primary types of certificates, each with a specific role in the chain of trust.

* **Certificate Authority (CA):** The CA is the ultimate root of trust for the entire system. It is a special certificate, typically with a long validity period (e.g., 10 years), that is used to digitally sign other certificates. By signing a certificate, the CA vouches for the identity of the subject named in that certificate. A SoftEther deployment can utilize an existing corporate CA, a public CA, or a self-signed CA created directly within the SoftEther VPN Server Manager or via its command-line tools.5 For most deployments, creating a dedicated, self-signed CA for the VPN is a secure and practical approach. The CA's private key is the most sensitive asset in the PKI and must be protected rigorously.  
* **Server Certificate:** This certificate is issued to and installed on the SoftEther VPN Server. It serves to identify the server to connecting clients. A critical attribute of the server certificate is the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN), which must match the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or IP address that clients use to connect to the server.5 This certificate is signed by the CA. When a client connects, it receives the server certificate and can verify its authenticity by checking the CA's signature.  
* **Client Certificate:** This certificate is issued to an individual user or device. Each client that needs to connect to the VPN receives its own unique certificate and the corresponding private key.4 Like the server certificate, the client certificate is also signed by the CA. The Common Name (CN) of the client certificate is typically set to the user's username for easy identification and policy enforcement on the server.5 When a user attempts to connect, the server verifies that their certificate was signed by the trusted CA and that the user associated with that certificate is authorized to access the network.

The relationship between these components forms the chain of trust: the client trusts the server's certificate because it was signed by a CA that the client is configured to trust. The server trusts the client's certificate because it was signed by a CA that the server is configured to trust. This mutual trust, rooted in a single CA, is the foundation of a secure, scalable, and password-less VPN infrastructure.

A crucial, and often overlooked, distinction within SoftEther's user configuration is between its two primary modes of certificate authentication: "Individual Certificate Authentication" and "Signed Certificate Authentication".5 "Individual Certificate Authentication" requires an administrator to create a user account and then manually associate a specific, individual client certificate file with that account.4 This creates a rigid, one-to-one mapping. If the user's certificate expires or is revoked, the administrator must manually upload and associate the new certificate with the user account in the server's configuration. This approach does not scale and creates significant administrative overhead.

In contrast, "Signed Certificate Authentication" represents a far more scalable and professional trust model. With this method, the administrator configures the server to trust any certificate that has been signed by a specific, designated CA.7 The server then authenticates the user based on an attribute within the presented certificate, typically by matching the certificate's Common Name (CN) to the username in the SoftEther user database. This decouples the user account from the specific certificate instance. An administrator can issue, renew, or revoke certificates using their CA infrastructure, and as long as the certificates are signed by the trusted CA and the CN matches an existing user, they will be accepted by the server without any changes to the SoftEther user configuration. For any deployment involving more than a few users, the "Signed Certificate Authentication" method is the unequivocally superior choice, aligning with standard enterprise PKI practices and enabling efficient lifecycle management.

## **Part 2: End-to-End Implementation Guide for Certificate Authentication (Using the Developer Edition)**

This section provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to implementing a complete PKI-based authentication system using SoftEther VPN. The instructions are based on the **Developer Edition**, which, as will be detailed in Part 3, is the recommended version for all new deployments due to its superior features and active maintenance. The procedures will cover both the graphical SoftEther VPN Server Manager for Windows and the vpncmd command-line utility, which is suitable for all platforms and essential for automation.

### **2.1 Establishing a Certificate Authority with SoftEther Tools**

The first step in building the PKI is to create the Certificate Authority (CA), which will serve as the root of trust for both the server and all connecting clients.

#### **Using the VPN Server Manager (GUI)**

1. Launch the SoftEther VPN Server Manager and connect to your VPN server instance.  
2. In the main window, click the **Manage Certificates** button. This will open the Certificate Management console.  
3. Click **New Certificate**. In the "Source" tab of the creation dialog, ensure that **Create a new Self-Signed Certificate** is selected.  
4. Navigate to the **Subject** tab. This is where you define the identity of your CA.  
   * **Internal Name:** Provide a descriptive name for management purposes (e.g., "MyVPN Root CA").  
   * **commonName (CN):** Enter a clear identifier for the CA (e.g., "My Company VPN Certificate Authority").  
   * **organizationName (O):** Enter your organization's name.  
5. Navigate to the **Extensions** tab.  
   * Set the **Duration** to a long period, such as 3650 days (10 years), which is standard practice for a root CA.5  
   * Ensure the **Certificate is a CA** checkbox is checked. This is critical for allowing this certificate to sign other certificates.  
6. Navigate to the **Key** tab.  
   * Select **RSA Key** and choose a strong key length. A 4096-bit key is highly recommended for modern security standards.5  
   * Click **Generate New Key**.  
7. Click **OK** to create the CA certificate. It will now appear in your list of certificates.  
8. **Crucial Security Step: Export and Secure the CA:**  
   * Select the newly created CA certificate from the list.  
   * Click **Export Certificate**. Choose the **X.509 Certificate (.CER)** format and save the public certificate file (e.g., ca.cer). This file is not secret and will be distributed to clients.  
   * Click **Export Certificate** again. This time, choose the **PKCS\#12 Certificate / Private Key (.PFX)** or individual key file format to export the private key. **The CA's private key is the most critical secret in your PKI.** It should be stored in a secure, offline location (like an encrypted USB drive in a safe) and, if possible, deleted from the live VPN server to minimize exposure.5

#### **Using vpncmd (CLI)**

The command-line utility provides a powerful way to script and automate certificate creation.

1. Start the utility by running vpncmd in your terminal.  
2. Select option **3** for "Use of VPN Tools".  
3. Execute the MakeCert2048 command to generate a new 2048-bit RSA certificate and private key (a 1024-bit MakeCert command also exists but is not recommended).4  
4. The command will prompt you for the certificate details. Fill them out as follows, pressing Enter to accept defaults where appropriate:  
   VPN Tools\> MakeCert2048  
   MakeCert2048 command \- Create New X.509 Certificate and Private Key (2048 bit)  
   Name of Certificate to Create (CN): My Company VPN Certificate Authority  
   Organization of Certificate to Create (O): My Company  
   Organization Unit of Certificate to Create (OU): IT Department  
   Country of Certificate to Create (C): US  
   State of Certificate to Create (ST): California  
   Locale of Certificate to Create (L): San Francisco  
   Serial Number of Certificate to Create (Hexadecimal):   
   Expiration Date of Certificate to Create (Days): 3650  
   File Name to Save Certificate to Create: /path/to/ca.cer  
   File Name to Save Private Key to Create: /path/to/ca.key

5. The command will create ca.cer (the public certificate) and ca.key (the private key) in the specified path. Secure the ca.key file immediately.

### **2.2 Server-Side Configuration**

With the CA established, the next step is to configure the VPN server to use a certificate signed by this CA and to authenticate users based on certificates from the same CA.

#### **Generating and Installing the Server Certificate**

The server needs its own unique certificate to prove its identity to clients. This certificate must be signed by the CA created in the previous step.

* **Using the GUI:** Follow the same steps as in 2.1.1 to create a new certificate. However, in the **Source** tab, select **Sign using another Certificate** and choose your newly created CA from the **Signing Certificate** dropdown. In the **Subject** tab, ensure the **commonName (CN)** exactly matches the FQDN of your VPN server (e.g., vpn.mycompany.com).5 Set a shorter duration, such as 2 years.  
* **Using the CLI:** The MakeCert2048 command does not directly support signing with another certificate. You would typically use a tool like OpenSSL for this or generate the server certificate via the GUI.

Once the server certificate and its private key are generated and exported, they must be installed on the server.

* **Using the GUI:**  
  1. In the VPN Server Manager main window, click **Encryption and Network Settings**.  
  2. Click **Import** and select the server's public certificate file (.cer).  
  3. You will be prompted for the corresponding private key file (.key). Select it to complete the import.8 The server will now present this certificate to connecting clients.  
* **Using the CLI:**  
  1. Start vpncmd and connect to your server in administration mode (option **1**).  
  2. Select the Virtual Hub you wish to manage, or operate at the server level.  
  3. Use the ServerCertSet command to load the certificate and key:  
     VPN Server/HUB\> ServerCertSet /LOADCERT:/path/to/server.cer /LOADKEY:/path/to/server.key

     This command instantly applies the new server certificate.4

#### **Configuring a Virtual Hub and Implementing the "Signed Certificate" Method**

This section details the recommended, scalable method for user authentication.

* **Using the GUI:**  
  1. First, the server must be configured to trust your CA. In the main Server Manager window, click **Manage Trusted CA Certificates**. Click **Add** and import the public ca.cer file. An alternative method is to copy the ca.cer file into the chain\_certs subdirectory within the SoftEther VPN Server installation directory.7  
  2. Select the desired Virtual Hub and click **Manage Virtual Hub**.  
  3. Click **Manage Users**.  
  4. Create a new user. Enter a **User Name** (e.g., "jane.doe").  
  5. For **Auth Type**, select **Signed Certificate Authentication**.  
  6. In the authentication settings pane on the right, click **Configure Settings for Signed Certificate Authentication**.  
  7. Select **Verify client certificate is issued by a trusted CA**. From the dropdown, select the CA you imported in step 1\.  
  8. For enhanced security, check the box for **Require the Common Name of the client certificate to be same as the User Name**. This ensures that only the certificate issued specifically to "jane.doe" can be used to log in as that user.7  
  9. Click **OK** to save the user configuration.  
* **Using the CLI:**  
  1. Connect to the server with vpncmd in administration mode.  
  2. Add the CA to the server's list of trusted CAs:  
     VPN Server\> CertAdd /LOADCERT:/path/to/ca.cer

     This command registers the CA globally on the server.10  
  3. Select the target Virtual Hub (e.g., Hub SECURE\_VPN).  
  4. Create the user and configure their authentication method with a single command:  
     VPN Server/SECURE\_VPN\> UserSignedSet jane.doe /CN:jane.doe

     This command creates the user "jane.doe" (if they don't exist), sets their authentication type to "Signed Certificate," and specifies that the Common Name on the presented certificate must be "jane.doe".4

### **2.3 Client-Side Configuration**

The final stage is to generate a unique certificate for a user and configure their SoftEther VPN Client to use it for authentication.

#### **Generating and Distributing Client Certificates**

For each user, you must generate a certificate signed by your CA.

1. Using either the GUI or a tool like OpenSSL, create a new certificate.  
2. Ensure it is signed by your Root CA.  
3. Set the **commonName (CN)** to the user's username (e.g., "jane.doe").5  
4. Generate a new, unique 4096-bit RSA key pair for this user.  
5. Export the client's public certificate (.cer or .pem) and, crucially, their **private key** (.key). For convenience, it is often best to bundle these into a single password-protected PKCS\#12 file (.pfx).  
6. **Security Warning:** The private key (or .pfx file) is the user's identity. It must be delivered to them through a secure, out-of-band channel. Email is not considered a secure channel for this purpose.

#### **Configuring the SoftEther VPN Client (GUI)**

1. On the user's machine, open the SoftEther VPN Client Manager.  
2. Double-click **Add VPN Connection** to create a new connection setting.12  
3. Fill in the server details: **Setting Name**, **Host Name**, **Port Number**, and **Virtual Hub Name**.  
4. In the **Auth Type** dropdown menu, select **Client Certificate Authentication**.12  
5. Enter the **User Name** (e.g., "jane.doe").  
6. Click the **Specify Client Certificate** button. In the new window, select **Import Certificate and Private Key** and browse to the user's .pfx file or their separate .cer and .key files to load their credentials into the client.12  
7. Click **OK** to save the connection setting.

#### **Configuring the SoftEther VPN Client (CLI)**

1. On the client machine, run vpncmd and select option **2** for "Management of VPN Client".  
2. Create the connection setting:  
   VPN Client\> AccountCreate MyVPN /SERVER:vpn.mycompany.com:443 /HUB:SECURE\_VPN /USERNAME:jane.doe /NICNAME:myvpn

3. Set the authentication type and specify the certificate and key files:  
   VPN Client\> AccountCertSet MyVPN /LOADCERT:/path/to/jane.doe.cer /LOADKEY:/path/to/jane.doe.key

   This command configures the "MyVPN" account to use the specified certificate for authentication.4

#### **Enabling Server Certificate Verification (Client-Side Hardening)**

To complete the secure setup and protect against MitM attacks, the client must be configured to validate the server's certificate.

* **Using the GUI:**  
  1. Open the properties for the VPN connection setting.  
  2. Under the server address, check the box for **Always Verify Server Certificate**.  
  3. The first time you connect, the client will display the server's certificate fingerprint and ask you to confirm and trust it. After this initial trust-on-first-use (TOFU), it will refuse to connect if the server certificate ever changes unexpectedly.3  
* **Using the CLI:**  
  1. Enable the verification option for the account:  
     VPN Client\> AccountServerCertEnable MyVPN

  2. For maximum security, you can pin the server's certificate by providing the client with a copy of the server's public .cer file:  
     VPN Client\> AccountServerCertSet MyVPN /LOADCERT:/path/to/server.cer

     This configures the client to *only* connect if the server presents this exact certificate, providing the strongest protection against MitM attacks.4

The ability to manage every aspect of the PKI lifecycle via vpncmd elevates SoftEther from a simple GUI-managed tool to a fully automatable infrastructure component. An administrator can create a comprehensive script (e.g., in Bash or PowerShell) that automates user onboarding. Such a script could accept a new username as an argument, then automatically call MakeCert2048 to generate a new client certificate signed by the CA, use vpncmd to create the corresponding user on the server with the UserSignedSet command, and finally bundle the certificate and private key into a .pfx file ready for secure distribution to the new user. This script-driven approach is invaluable in large-scale or DevOps-oriented environments, enabling consistent, repeatable, and secure deployments without manual intervention.

## **Part 3: Comparative Analysis: Stable Edition vs. Developer Edition**

Choosing the correct version of SoftEther VPN is a critical decision that directly impacts the security, functionality, and maintainability of the deployment. The project maintains two primary branches: the **Stable Edition (SE)** and the **Developer Edition (DE)**. The naming convention is misleading and has historically caused significant confusion. A thorough, evidence-based analysis reveals that for any new deployment, particularly one focused on robust certificate authentication, the Developer Edition is not merely an option but a necessity.

### **3.1 Development Philosophy, Stability, and Release Cadence**

The fundamental difference between the two editions lies in their development philosophy and maintenance cycle.

* **The Stable Edition (SE):** This version is positioned as a mature, long-term support (LTS) release, intended for production environments where change is minimized. In practice, however, its release cadence is exceptionally slow. The official changelog shows that major RTM (Release to Manufacturing) versions are published years apart; for example, version 4.42 was released in June 2023\.14 This infrequent update schedule means that SE often lags significantly behind in adopting new security standards, protocols, and patches for vulnerabilities that may have been discovered and fixed in the DE branch. Forum discussions reflect this reality, with some users describing it as a "mature 10yo project which needs no weekly bug fixes," while others correctly perceive this as being effectively unmaintained and outdated.15  
* **The Developer Edition (DE):** This is the main, actively developed branch of SoftEther VPN, with its source code hosted on the primary GitHub repository.16 It receives frequent updates, bug fixes, and new features, with tagged releases often appearing on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.17 Despite the "Developer" moniker suggesting instability, it is the version that incorporates the latest security patches, performance improvements, and protocol support. Furthermore, it is the version packaged by major Linux distributions like Debian, indicating a broader community consensus on its stability for production use.15 The name is a misnomer; it should be considered the "Modern" or "Mainline" edition of the software.

Choosing the Stable Edition based on its name introduces significant risk. An administrator would be deploying software that is demonstrably less secure, less functional, and potentially vulnerable to exploits that have long been patched in the Developer Edition. The "stability" of SE is one of stasis, not of proven resilience through continuous maintenance. Therefore, the only professionally responsible choice for a new deployment is the Developer Edition.

### **3.2 A Feature-by-Feature Analysis of Authentication Capabilities**

When focusing specifically on certificate authentication and related security features, the Developer Edition's superiority becomes even more pronounced. The Stable Edition contains critical limitations that render it unsuitable for a modern, secure PKI deployment.

The following table provides a direct comparison of key features between the two editions, highlighting the strategic implications for administrators.

| Feature | Stable Edition (SE) | Developer Edition (DE) | Strategic Implication for Administrators |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Certificate Authentication (Protocols)** | Supported for **SSL-VPN only**.16 | Supported across **all protocols** (SSL-VPN, OpenVPN, etc.).16 | **Critical:** DE is required for certificate authentication with standard clients like OpenVPN. SE's limitation causes major compatibility issues and forces password use for other protocols. |
| **TLS Server Verification** | Requires client to pin the exact server certificate or its issuing CA.16 | Can perform **standard TLS verification** using the client's system CA store.16 | DE enables zero-touch client configuration when using publicly trusted CAs (e.g., Let's Encrypt), as clients trust them by default. SE requires manual client updates upon server certificate renewal, creating significant operational overhead. |
| **ECDSA Certificate Support** | Not supported. Cannot import ECDSA certificates.16 | **Fully supported**.16 | DE allows the use of modern, more efficient Elliptic Curve Cryptography for certificates, which offers equivalent security to RSA with smaller key sizes and faster performance. |
| **RADIUS / NT Domain Auth** | Included in official pre-compiled Windows builds, but may be **absent from self-compiled versions**.15 | Functionality is **always included in the source code**, ensuring consistent availability across platforms.15 | DE provides more reliable and predictable integration with existing enterprise authentication systems, especially in non-Windows or custom-compiled environments. |
| **WireGuard® Protocol Support** | Not supported.16 | **Fully supported**.16 | DE provides access to the high-performance, modern WireGuard protocol, which is a significant advantage for speed and mobile client battery life. SE lacks this entirely. |
| **IPv6 Route Management** | Limited support (L2 tunnels only).16 | **Full support**, including IPv6 route management for Windows clients.16 | DE is future-proof and suitable for modern dual-stack or IPv6-only networks. SE's capabilities are insufficient for complex IPv6 deployments. |
| **JSON-RPC API / HTML5 Console** | Not available. Relies on older VPN Server Manager and vpncmd.19 | Includes a **modern JSON-RPC API** and an embedded HTML5 admin console.16 | DE is vastly superior for automation, monitoring, and integration with modern infrastructure management tools. The API allows for complete programmatic control of the VPN server. |
| **Release Cadence / Active Maintenance** | Infrequent, years between major releases.14 | Frequent, with continuous bug fixes and security patches.18 | DE provides timely security updates and access to the latest features, while SE may remain vulnerable to known exploits for extended periods. |

This analysis makes the choice clear. The Stable Edition's restrictions on certificate authentication to SSL-VPN only, its rigid server verification mechanism, and its lack of support for modern cryptography and protocols make it a legacy product. The Developer Edition provides the full suite of features necessary to build a secure, scalable, and manageable VPN service that aligns with current industry best practices.

### **3.3 Beyond Authentication: Other Critical Differentiators**

The advantages of the Developer Edition extend well beyond authentication. The inclusion of modern protocols and management interfaces fundamentally changes the capabilities of the platform.

* **Protocol Support:** The most significant differentiator is the DE's support for **WireGuard®**.16 WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol known for its simplicity, high performance, and small attack surface. Its inclusion makes the DE a far more compelling solution for use cases requiring high throughput or for battery-sensitive mobile clients. The DE also supports L2TPv3 and EtherIP, expanding its interoperability options.16  
* **IPv6 Capabilities:** As networks increasingly transition to IPv6, proper support is no longer optional. The SE's support is rudimentary, limited to layer-2 bridged tunnels. The DE provides more robust IPv6 functionality, including the ability to manage and push IPv6 routes to clients, which is essential for proper layer-3 routing in a dual-stack environment.16  
* **API and Management:** The introduction of the JSON-RPC API Suite in the Developer Edition is a transformative feature.19 It allows administrators to programmatically manage every aspect of the VPN server—from creating users and hubs to disconnecting sessions—using standard web technologies. This enables seamless integration with automation platforms like Ansible or Terraform, custom management dashboards, and other orchestration tools. The embedded HTML5 admin console also provides a modern, web-based alternative to the desktop-only VPN Server Manager.16 These features are completely absent in the Stable Edition, which remains locked into manual management via its legacy tools.

## **Part 4: Advanced Configurations and Security Hardening**

Once the foundational certificate-based authentication is in place using the Developer Edition, administrators can further enhance security and operational efficiency by integrating external services and employing hardware-based security measures. This section covers advanced configurations for production environments.

### **4.1 Integrating External and Public Certificate Authorities**

While SoftEther's built-in tools are capable of creating a self-signed CA, integrating with an external or public CA offers significant advantages in terms of trust distribution and automation.

#### **Using Let's Encrypt**

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority that is trusted by default in virtually all modern operating systems and browsers. Using a Let's Encrypt certificate for your SoftEther VPN server provides two key benefits: it eliminates the need to manually distribute and install your self-signed CA on every client device, and it enforces good security hygiene through its mandatory 90-day certificate lifetime.11 This is only practical with the Developer Edition's ability to use the system CA store for verification.16

The process involves automating both certificate issuance and installation:

1. **Install Certbot:** Install the certbot client on your VPN server.  
2. **Obtain the Certificate:** Use certbot to obtain a certificate. The DNS-01 challenge is often preferable for servers that may not be accessible on port 80, as it works by creating a temporary TXT record in your domain's DNS zone.11  
   Bash  
   certbot certonly \--manual \--preferred-challenges dns \-d vpn.mycompany.com

3. **Automate Renewal and Installation:** Certbot automatically configures a cron job or systemd timer for renewal. You must add a "deploy hook" script that runs after a successful renewal. This script will use vpncmd to load the newly issued certificate and private key into SoftEther VPN Server.  
   Bash  
   \#\!/bin/bash  
   VPN\_HOST="localhost"  
   VPN\_PASS="YourAdminPassword"  
   CERT\_PATH="/etc/letsencrypt/live/vpn.mycompany.com/fullchain.pem"  
   KEY\_PATH="/etc/letsencrypt/live/vpn.mycompany.com/privkey.pem"

   /usr/local/vpnserver/vpncmd /server:$VPN\_HOST /password:$VPN\_PASS /cmd ServerCertSet /LOADCERT:$CERT\_PATH /LOADKEY:$KEY\_PATH

   This script, when configured as a certbot deploy hook, ensures that the VPN server's certificate is always up-to-date with zero manual intervention.11

#### **Using a Corporate/Internal CA**

In enterprise environments with an existing PKI, SoftEther can be seamlessly integrated. The process involves making the SoftEther server trust the corporate CA.

1. Obtain the public certificate file (e.g., CorporateRootCA.cer) for your organization's Root CA or relevant Intermediate CA.  
2. Import this certificate into SoftEther's list of trusted CAs using either the GUI (**Manage Trusted CA Certificates**) or the vpncmd utility:  
   VPN Server\> CertAdd /LOADCERT:/path/to/CorporateRootCA.cer

   Alternatively, place the CA certificate file in the chain\_certs directory of the SoftEther installation.7  
3. Once trusted, the SoftEther server can validate server and client certificates issued by this corporate CA, allowing the VPN to become a fully integrated component of the enterprise security infrastructure.

### **4.2 Hardware-Based Security: Using Smart Cards and USB Tokens**

For the highest level of client-side security, private keys should be stored on dedicated cryptographic hardware like smart cards or USB tokens. This practice ensures that the private key never resides on the computer's hard drive, protecting it from theft by malware or physical compromise of the device.2 The cryptographic operations (e.g., signing) are performed directly on the hardware token, which typically requires a PIN for activation.

SoftEther VPN Client supports any smart card or USB token that is compatible with the PKCS\#11 standard.2

1. **Install Device Drivers:** Ensure the necessary drivers and middleware for the smart card reader and token are installed on the client computer.  
2. **Load Key and Certificate:** Use the utility provided by the hardware manufacturer to load the user's client certificate and private key onto the device.  
3. **Configure SoftEther Client:**  
   * In the SoftEther VPN Client Manager, go to the **Smart Card** menu and select **Select Which Smart Card to Use**.  
   * Choose the appropriate PKCS\#11 module or driver for your device from the list.22  
   * In the VPN connection settings, when specifying the client certificate, the client will now be able to access the certificate stored on the hardware token. When connecting, the user will be prompted by the device's middleware to enter their PIN.

It is important to note that the documentation mentions a potential limitation where SoftEther may not handle RSA keys stronger than 1024 bits stored on smart cards.22 This should be tested with the specific hardware in use.

### **4.3 Troubleshooting Common Authentication Failures**

When certificate authentication fails, the cause is typically related to a break in the chain of trust.

* **Diagnosing Certificate Validation Errors:**  
  * **Expired Certificate:** Check the validity period of the client, server, and CA certificates.  
  * **Common Name (CN) Mismatch:** If the server is configured to match the CN against the username, ensure they are identical. For the server certificate, ensure its CN matches the FQDN used by the client.  
  * **Untrusted CA:** The most common issue. Ensure the client trusts the CA that signed the server certificate, and the server trusts the CA that signed the client certificate. This involves correctly distributing the public CA certificate to all parties.  
* **Addressing OpenVPN Client Compatibility:**  
  * Historical forum posts show user confusion and mixed results when trying to use certificate authentication with third-party OpenVPN clients.6 This is almost always due to using the Stable Edition of SoftEther VPN Server, which only supports this feature for the native SSL-VPN protocol.  
  * **Resolution:** Use the **Developer Edition** of SoftEther VPN Server. It provides full and proper support for certificate authentication with OpenVPN clients. When generating the .ovpn configuration file, ensure it includes the client's certificate and private key, as well as the CA certificate.  
* **Resolving Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Issues:**  
  * Some VPN clients, notably the native Windows SSTP client, will attempt to check the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution point specified in the server's certificate. If this URL is inaccessible from the public internet (e.g., it points to an internal server), the client may refuse to connect.8  
  * **Workarounds:**  
    1. When issuing the server certificate from your CA, configure the certificate template to not include CRL distribution point information.  
    2. On Windows clients, a registry key can be set to disable the CRL check for the SSTP service, though this slightly reduces security: HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SstpSvc\\Parameters\\NoCertRevocationCheck=1 (REG\_DWORD).8

## **Conclusion: Strategic Recommendations for Deployment**

This comprehensive analysis of SoftEther VPN's certificate authentication capabilities leads to a clear and unambiguous set of strategic recommendations for administrators seeking to deploy a secure and modern VPN solution. The choice of software version, authentication methodology, and security hardening practices are paramount to achieving this goal.

### **The Unambiguous Recommendation for the Developer Edition**

The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the **Developer Edition (DE) is the only appropriate choice for all new SoftEther VPN deployments**. The "Stable Edition" (SE) should be considered a legacy version, unsuitable for environments with modern security and performance requirements. The "Stable" vs. "Developer" naming convention is a historical misnomer that creates a significant risk; choosing SE based on its name results in the deployment of a less secure, less functional, and effectively unmaintained platform. The DE provides superior security through active maintenance and timely patches, broader functionality with support for modern protocols like WireGuard®, and enhanced manageability via its JSON-RPC API.

### **Scenario-Based Guidance**

* **For All New Deployments:**  
  * Deploy the latest tagged release of the **Developer Edition**.  
  * Implement the **"Signed Certificate Authentication"** method for user management. This provides the scalability and flexibility required for any environment with more than a handful of users.  
  * Utilize an external or public CA, such as **Let's Encrypt**, for the server certificate. This simplifies client configuration and leverages automated renewal, reducing administrative overhead and improving security posture.  
* **For Existing Stable Edition Deployments:**  
  * A migration plan to the Developer Edition should be a high-priority initiative.  
  * The justification for this upgrade is compelling: access to critical security patches, support for modern and high-performance protocols, compatibility with modern cryptographic standards (ECDSA), and the ability to automate and integrate the VPN server into a modern IT infrastructure. The operational and security risks of remaining on the unmaintained SE branch are substantial.

### **Final Security Checklist for a Production Environment**

To ensure a robust and secure production deployment of SoftEther VPN, the following checklist should be adhered to:

1. **Use a Secure CA:** The CA's private key must be generated and stored securely, preferably offline. If using an external CA, follow its best practices.  
2. **Enforce Server Certificate Verification:** All clients must be configured to verify the server's certificate to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Pinning the specific server certificate provides the highest level of security.  
3. **Unique Client Credentials:** Each user and/or device must be issued a unique client certificate and private key. Do not share client credentials.  
4. **Implement Hardware Tokens:** For high-security environments, require users to store their client private keys on PKCS\#11-compatible smart cards or USB tokens.  
5. **Establish Certificate Lifecycle Management:** Define clear policies for certificate issuance, renewal, and, most importantly, revocation. A compromised certificate must be able to be revoked immediately.  
6. **Maintain Software Updates:** Regularly update the SoftEther VPN Developer Edition server and clients to the latest tagged release to benefit from the most recent security patches and feature improvements.
